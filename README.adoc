= 🌱 Sprouter

Sprouter is a lightweight Kubernetes operator that automatically propagates annotated ConfigMaps and Secrets to every namespace in the cluster — creating "sprouts" from the original "seed".

Sprouter is ideal for sharing common configuration across teams, environments, or tenants in a multi-namespace setup.

== ✨ Features

🖁️ Automatically syncs ConfigMaps and Secrets to all namespaces

🧽 Cleans up propagated copies when the seed is deleted

🚀 Propagates seeds to new namespaces upon creation

🔍 Uses annotations to control propagation behavior

♻️ Only updates when the Seed's data changes using content-based hashing

== 🌿 How It Works

Sprouter watches all ConfigMaps and Secrets.If a resource is annotated with:

----
metadata:
  annotations:
    sprouter.geeko.me/enabled: "true"
----

…it is considered a Seed. Sprouter then:

- Copies it to every existing namespace.
- Re-copies it if the source is updated.
- Deletes all propagated copies if the source is deleted.

Ensures the resource is automatically present in any new namespace created after.

== 📆 Installation

----
helm install sprouter \
  oci://ghcr.io/hierynomus/sprouter/charts/sprouter
----

== 🧪 Development

Build locally: `cargo build`

Run tests: `cargo test`

Build Docker image: `docker build -t sprouter:latest .`

== 🔐 Permissions (RBAC)

Sprouter requires cluster-wide permissions to:

- Read all ConfigMaps, Secrets, and Namespaces
- Write to all namespaces

== 📜 Annotation Format

Sprouter only propagates resources annotated with:

----
sprouter.geeko.me/enabled: "true"
----

== 🧠 Naming

- Seed: the original annotated ConfigMap or Secret
- Sprout: the copies created in each namespace
- Sprouter: the operator casting those seeds across the cluster
